This is my personal collection of advanced Excel formulas that I find intriguing and worth sharing.
I prefer not to drag formulas down, so most files utilize dynamic arrays, requiring Excel 365. 
I've also created custom LAMBDA functions that can be called and reused just like standard Excel functions.
